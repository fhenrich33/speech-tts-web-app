 * Implement the CurrentlyReading component here

 * - A p tag containing the current sentence with testID "current-sentence"
 * - A span tag inside the p tag containing the current word with testID "current-word"
 *
 * See example.gif for an example of how the component should look like, feel free to style it however you want as long as the testID exists
